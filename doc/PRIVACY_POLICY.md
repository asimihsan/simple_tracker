## Your Rights

If you reside in certain territories, including the EU, you have a number of rights in
relation to your personal information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain
rights apply only in certain limited cases. I describe these rights below:

-   **Access**. You may have the right to access and receive a copy of the personal
    information I hold about you by contacting me using the contact information below.
-   **Change, restrict, delete**. You may also have rights to change, restrict my use of,
    or delete your personal information. Absent exceptional circumstances (like where I am
    required to store data for legal reasons) I will generally delete your personal
    information upon request.
-   **Object**. You can object to (i) my processing of some of your information based on
    my legitimate interests and (ii) receiving marketing messages from me after providing
    your express consent to receive them. In such cases, I will delete your personal
    information unless I have compelling and legitimate grounds to continue using that
    information or if it is needed for legal reasons.
-   **Complain**. If you reside in the EU and wish to raise a concern about my use of your
    information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the
    right to do so with your local data protection authority.
