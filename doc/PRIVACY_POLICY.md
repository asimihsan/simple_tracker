## Your Rights

If you reside in certain territories, including the EU, you have a number of rights in relation to your
personal information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited
cases. I describe these rights below:

-   **Access**. You may have the right to access and receive a copy of the personal information I hold about
    you by contacting me using the contact information below.
-   **Change, restrict, delete**. You may also have rights to change, restrict my use of, or delete your
    personal information. Absent exceptional circumstances (like where I am required to store data for legal
    reasons) I will generally delete your personal information upon request.
-   **Object**. You can object to (i) my processing of some of your information based on my legitimate
    interests and (ii) receiving marketing messages from me after providing your express consent to receive
    them. In such cases, I will delete your personal information unless I have compelling and legitimate
    grounds to continue using that information or if it is needed for legal reasons.
-   **Complain**. If you reside in the EU and wish to raise a concern about my use of your information (and
    without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local data
    protection authority.

## How to Contact Me

For purpose of EU data protection law, I, Asim Ihsan, am the data controller of your personal information. If
